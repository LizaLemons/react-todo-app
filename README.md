# React Todo App

---


**Liza's notes:**

This is a simple todo app. You can add and delete todo items.

1. This app doesn't have a BE or DB.

1. User submits a new task with the `enter` key instead of a submit button.

1. Completed tasks turn gray.

1. Installed `immutability-helper` in order to update pieces of state individually (check out the docs)
  - `npm install --save immutability-helper`
  - `import update from 'immutability-helper';`

**Original Homework Assignment**


You are going to be building a **React TODO app** tonight that allows the user to do the following:

- See a list of tasks
- Create tasks
- Mark a task as completed (possibly through checking a checkbox)
- Delete tasks
- **Bonus:** edit tasks
